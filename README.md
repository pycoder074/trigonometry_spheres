# Math Spheres

Welcome to the Bouncing Spheres project! This repository contains code that visually demonstrates spheres bouncing around on the screen using sine, cosine, and tangent ratios.

This project showcases an animation where spheres move in a bouncing motion across the screen. The movement of the spheres is calculated using trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent.

Features
  - Animated spheres with smooth motion.
  - Trigonometric functions to control movement.
  - Customizable parameters for the number of spheres, speed, and size.

# Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository:

  ``git clone https://github.com/your-username/bouncing-spheres.git
  cd bouncing-spheres``

Ensure you have Python installed.

2. Install the required dependencies:

  ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

3. Run
  To run the animation, execute the following command in your terminal:

``python main.py``

# Contributing to this project

If you have a new feature, create a pull request! It doesn't have to be using trigonometry ratios, it can use other maths rules as well!
